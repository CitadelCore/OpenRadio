# OpenRadio
A Little OpenComputers addon which adds laser links and (planned) satelites with radios, antennas and other high frequency stuff :3

## Current status
* Lasers check if they have an opponent via regular entities (currently visible for debugging. 1 entity per second).
* I need better textures for the two laser tubes (Laser item tier 2 and 3).
