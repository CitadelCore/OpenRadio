Mod ideen:

laser link:
	needs line-of-sight
	long distances
	different lenses (Diamond, Quartz, Glass and others)
	The probability that a Packet gets lost increases with decrease of signal quality (Transparent blocks & distance decrease quality, better components make link quality better)
	Blocks: (multiple tiers?)
		-Laser Casing
		-Mirror
		-Laser HV power supply for better Lasers
		-NSA-o-mat (aka the signal interceptor)

	Ich you run through a laser on eye-height you get Blindness for a few seconds
	latency is calculated through distance and gets increased through a signal interceptor

	Link check:
	    -first time check through a flying Entity -> intra-dimensional through portals possible
	    -air blocks get marked by a overrideable block (like tall grass but invisible)
	    -transparent blocks get randomly polled every few seconds

Satellites:
    Satellites and huge multiblock radio dishes :3
	Galacticraft integration:
	    -from Earth you can only reach space stations and the moon. bigger distances possible from there (other planets)

	Blocks:
	    -Antenna:
	        -Multiblock dish antenna (very strong signal possible -> high data rate)
	        -Omnidirectional antenna (not a very good signal but preferred signal direction. good for near field (<1000 blocks) communication)
	    -Coaxial cable
	        get the signal from the radio to the antenna.
	        -not needed (radio can be placed at the base of the antenna)
	        -has signal loss over distance
	    -Radio
	        converts the network messages to "radio waves"
	        -different tiers with better input amp and higher output power
	        -higher packet rate and less packet loss with higher tiers
	    -Satellite
	        has get into an orbit somehow :P

AE2 integration:
    maybe link two AE2-networks over a laser link?
