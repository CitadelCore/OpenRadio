laser link:
	needs line-of-sight
	long distances
	different lenses (Diamond, Quartz, Glass and others)
	The probability that a Packet gets lost increases with decrease of signal quality (Transparent blocks & distance decrease quality, better components make link quality better)
	Blocks: (multiple tiers?)
		-Laser Casing
		-Mirror
		-Laser HV power supply for better Lasers
		    lasers tier 2 and 3 need a separate power supply which has to be powered by RF
		-Signal Sniffer (aka the NSA-o-mat (I don't think you will get that pun if you don't speak german ^^)) alternative names: Big Brother, Spy Machine, NSA in a box
			increases the signal latency (so it can be detected if someone spies on you :P)

	If you run through a laser on eye-height you get Blindness for a few seconds
	latency is calculated through distance and gets increased through a signal sniffer

	Link check:
	    -first time check through a flying Entity -> intra-dimensional through portals possible
	    -air blocks get marked by a overrideable block (like tall grass but invisible)
	    -transparent blocks get randomly polled every few seconds
	        Maybe only allow two transparent blocks without air in between. this would eliminate the need for polling and the fake-air-blocks could just check (if one of their neighbours is one of the transparent blocks) on block updates, if their neighbor still is the block it was.
		New (probably better) idea:
		    store a list of all block coords in between (using the fired entity) and check one of them each random block update (isChunk loaded? is block air or transparent?)


Satellites:
    Satellites and huge multiblock radio dishes :3
	Galacticraft integration:
	    -from Earth you can only reach space stations and the moon. bigger distances possible from there (other planets)

	Blocks:
	    -Antenna:
	        -Multiblock dish antenna (very strong signal possible -> high data rate)
	        -Omnidirectional antenna (not a very good signal but preferred signal direction. good for near field (<1000 blocks) communication)
	    -Coaxial cable
	        get the signal from the radio to the antenna.
	        -not needed (radio can be placed at the base of the antenna)
	        -has signal loss over distance
	    -Radio
	        converts the network messages to "radio waves"
	        -different tiers with better input amp and higher output power
	        -higher packet rate and less packet loss with higher tiers
	    -Satellite
	        has get into an orbit somehow :P

AE2 integration:
    maybe link two AE2-networks over a laser link?
